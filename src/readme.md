The file assets/checkout.jpg shows a checkout form. Users are presented with a list of payment options with which they can complete their already initiated transaction.

The goal of this task is to recreate the checkout form as shown as in the image as closely as possible and display a success message once the continue button is clicked

Notes
The continue button should only be enabled when a selection has been made
The details of the selection should be logged to the console
